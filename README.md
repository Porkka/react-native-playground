WIP: Testing React Native

Fonts
https://fonts.google.com/
In this project, we are using Roboto from Google Fonts

When importing files to workspace:
- The name should be lowercase
- There shouldn't be any spaces in the name
- Use an underscore to define the style, for example, roboto_bold

Font Icons

In this project, we are just using MaterialCommunityIcons
